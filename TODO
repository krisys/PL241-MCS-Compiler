* Take care of statSeq which are empty (optional) especially in case of if-then-else-fi, function body and while statements.
* Handle function branch and return
* Every call to a function should check if the function is already defined.
* Implement the parser and stuff for procedures.
* Function/Procedures cannot take arrays as arguments.
* For function calls do calling vs formal parameters checking if the numbers match.
* Take care of "return" with no expression case.
* Array dimension checking in parser.
